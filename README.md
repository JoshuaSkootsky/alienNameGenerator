# Alien Name Generator

Uses JavaScript to generate an 'alien name translation' based on input.

My goal was to make a website for my students at Thinkful to see an advanced version of a concept they've seen before in the curiculuum. This site demonstrates how 

# Features

* Randomization
* Displays on input into the text field
* Find out what your alien name is!
* Translate an alien name back into human language!

# Details
There is an input field with an event listener. Whenever there is input, the event is triggered, and that runs a JavaScript function on the contents of the input field, which generates an alien name. The alien name is supposed to be cool, and it also randomly maps letters to elements of a corresponding array, so it isn't totally predictible.

This demonstrates how reactivity can be done with Vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks necessary. On a larger website, the extra work of a framework and Webpack can be worth setting up because it also comes with the tools for handling the extra complexity. 

This is a small, simple page that does one thing, and it does it well.
