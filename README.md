There's some cool stuff going on. ASCIIness is tested by using charCodeAt. If the charCode is above 127... it isn't ASCII!

Some lightweight vanilla JS reactivity is included. The isAscii script runs whenever changes are made to the input field. The input field also has autocomplete turned off so that the suggestions don't get in the way of displaying the result... is it ASCII?
